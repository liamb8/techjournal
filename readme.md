# Tech Journal

Welcome to my Tech Journal, a repository that showcases my academic and extracurricular experiences in the domain of cybersecurity and systems administration.

## College Coursework

During my academic years, I was fortunate enough to explore a wide range of subjects in-depth. Below are the courses I undertook, each offering a unique perspective on systems and cybersecurity:

- **Enterprise Virtualization (SYS350)**: Delved into the realm of server-based virtualization technologies focusing on server consolidation, automation, advanced Windows Active Directory configurations, and ensuring high availability in enterprise environments.
- **Systems Security (SEC440)**: A holistic journey through the different facets of security including hardware, software, malware, protocols, and threat models. The hands-on component involved securing operational networks from potential threats.
- **Enterprise and Network Security Controls (SEC350)**: A deep dive into network-based threats, protection mechanisms, and the intricate relationship between user policies and network security. Engaged in hands-on experiments, in-depth projects, and enlightening presentations.
- **Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing (SEC335)**: Explored the vulnerabilities lurking in software systems, network services, and learned methods to fortify Internet servers. The curriculum also emphasized security ethics and the nuances of incident response.
- **System Admin. & Network Services II (SYS265)**: Engaged in a project-based study of the administration of distributed computing environments. Topics covered include AAA systems, cross-platform authentication, host-based firewalls, DHCP, DNS, and an introduction to network monitoring tools.
- **Network Protocols (NET215)**: Undertook a comprehensive analysis of foundational Internet and enterprise network protocols in line with the TCP/IP and OSI models. Gained hands-on experience with protocol analysis and grasped the importance of protocol development, structure, and their synergy with network-based applications.
- **Cloud Administration & Deployment (SYS360)**: Ventured into the world of commercial PAAS cloud offerings. The course covered a vast array of topics including current cloud platforms, techniques for secure deployment, and the art of integrating cloud architectures with legacy systems. Additionally, I delved deeper into advanced Linux concepts, especially in a cloud context.

## HackTheBox Training and TryHackMe Adventures

Outside of my structured academic curriculum, I'm fervently training on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) following the "Security Analyst" path. Moreover, I've embarked on the "Security Engineer" segment on [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com/), consistently broadening my skill set.
