# SIEM Visualization Example 1: Failed Logon Attempts (All Users)



## Summary:

In this lab, I crafted a comprehensive dashboard visualization in Kibana, focusing on tracking failed logon attempts across all users on Windows systems. The process began with the integration of a filter based on the event ID `4625 â€“ Failed logon attempt on a Windows system`. Transitioning to the visualization phase, I selected a table format and incorporated rows for both the `user.name.keyword` field, representing the specific username associated with the failed logon, and the `host.hostname.keyword` field, denoting the system's hostname. To offer a quantitative insight into the security incidents, I integrated a metrics row utilizing the count function, thereby displaying the total number of failed logon attempts.

The dashboard can also be refined further by adding clearer column names, logon type, and sorting the results. See the screenshot below for the updated version:
